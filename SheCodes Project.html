   <b> What is Greek yogurt?</b><br/>
    Yogurt is a dairy product that has been consumed since ancient times. In fact, the Greeks were the first to document the
    use of yogurt in 100 BC.
   The word ‚Äúyogurt‚Äù is believed to have come from the Turkish word ‚Äúyoƒüurmak,‚Äù which means to thicken, curdle, or
    coagulate.
     Many types of yogurt are available, including Greek-style, which has a higher protein content than other yogurt products.
    Greek yogurt, often referred to as ‚Äústrained‚Äù yogurt, is made by fermenting yogurt in tanks and then straining whey and
    other liquids during the final processing steps. The process results in a thicker product with a higher protein content.
    Additionally, some food manufacturers produce Greek-style yogurt by adding milk proteins to the yogurt at the beginning
    or end of processing (2Trusted Source).
    Greek yogurt comes in many varieties, including full fat, reduced fat, and fat-free, as well as flavored and unflavored.
     Greek yogurt is high in many nutrients and a good source of protein, fat, and carbs, depending on the brand you choose.
